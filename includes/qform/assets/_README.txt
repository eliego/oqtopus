This directory is for assets and helpers for the varoius QControls,
including images, javascript files and popups.

Of course, these files can technically be anywhere in the docroot,
but the directory location of /includes/qform/assets is meant to serve
as a centrally-available assets location for these QControl helpers.

Feel free to add/modify as you wish.

And also, any additional QControl classes that you create or download which
may have their own assets should have their assets installed in this
directory.
